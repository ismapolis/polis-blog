  "Over the past few years, you’ve likely heard about the 2030 Agenda. Since its approval in 2015, it has gradually influenced almost every aspect of our lives: from justifying projects aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to laws that might seem unusual, such as bans on glitter or ham-flavored potato chips. While some measures may seem disconnected from everyday reality, they are usually based on international studies and research.\n\nThis is part of a broader trend, where sustainability has moved from being a marginal consideration to a cross-cutting criterion, reaching details as specific as microplastics in glitter. In this context, the European Sustainable Product Regulation (ESPR) emerges as one of the latest European Commission initiatives to advance a circular economy. This is not the first regulation of its kind: a 2009 directive already focused on energy-consuming products. The difference now is that the scope has broadened to apply to virtually any physical product entering the market.\n\nTraditionally, the approach to a more sustainable society relied on the “3R” strategy: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. ESPR expands this to the “9R” strategy, introducing new Rs such as: Reject (avoid unsustainable products at the design stage); Rethink (redesign for durability); Repair, Refurbish, and Rebuild; and Recover (e.g., incinerate waste to obtain energy). Together, the 9Rs promote smarter production and consumption, extend product lifespans, and suggest uses for discarded materials.\n\nThese requirements are not the ESPR’s only responsibility. It also mandates that public European bodies purchase more sustainable versions of goods and services. Measures include prohibiting disposal of unsold products, especially in textiles and footwear, and opening this approach to new sectors. Crucially, it introduces the **Digital Product Passport (DPP)**: a digital identity for products, components, and materials with relevant information. The regulation does not specify exact content or technical implementation, only minimum requirements.\n\nIn general terms, these requirements focus on ensuring secure and controlled access to passport data for all actors involved in a product’s lifecycle. The information must be authentic, integral, and available throughout the product’s life. For example, someone buying a second-hand phone—like a classic Blackberry on a marketplace—should be able to verify authenticity, check repair history, and find recycling instructions, even if the original manufacturer no longer exists (Blackberry ceased operations in 2016), while ensuring reliable information.\n\nWhile the digital product passport concept sounds promising, it raises questions due to the ESPR’s lack of detail. Implementation will be gradual and slow. Initially, it aimed to be operational by the end of 2025 for batteries—now postponed to 2027—and later expanded to other sectors every three years.\n\nThis raises key questions: where is the limit? Will even a shoelace eyelet require its own digital passport? In many cases, the cost of implementing and maintaining the passport could far exceed the product’s value. This is one of the main challenges in creating a universal passport applicable across industries, as industrial differences lead to varying needs and requirements.\n\nFor instance, in the energy sector—the first target industry—tracking per battery unit is crucial. Last year alone, Europe imported nearly a million tons of lithium batteries, a highly polluting material if not recycled properly. Conversely, tracking every manufactured screw at this level would be pointless. ESPR allows passport granularity choices: unit, batch, or product model. Here, the regulation’s ambiguity is an advantage.\n\n## ITI’s Role\n\nITI has been working on self-sovereign identity and blockchain technologies for several years. We won’t dive into technical details here, but the Digital Product Passport is essentially a digital identity for products, capturing key information. Our expertise in these technologies aligns perfectly with ESPR’s requirements. Some readers may note that blockchain and energy savings do not always go hand in hand—Bitcoin, for example, consumed around 150 TWh in 2024, roughly three times Portugal’s energy use. Not all blockchains are the same: many operate with minimal energy while maintaining servers without cryptocurrency mining.\n\nThis digital product passport solution, based on self-sovereign identity and blockchain, is part of the **OMEGA project**, representing our contribution to the international research effort. Valencian companies in the footwear and battery sectors have agreed to collaborate on the next phase, bringing our solution to real-world applications.

  "The Users’ Insurrection: Freeing Digital Identity from Corporate Control",
  "How self-sovereign identity can restore control over personal data in the digital age.",

  "The Industrial Revolution and the arrival of machinery in textile factories represented a total disruption in the sector. The process shifted from requiring highly specialized labor to perform a relatively slow task to allowing anyone to operate a machine in a much faster and more efficient process. Countless workers left the countryside or other jobs with the promise of more stable, better-paid, and less exhausting work. However, this turned out to be a poisoned gift, as eventually the lack of regulation trapped these workers in 14-hour or longer shifts, six days a week, under dangerous working conditions with numerous factory accidents. The absence of alternatives made workers completely dependent on these jobs and consequently subject to labor abuse. This situation eventually erupted, leading to strikes such as “La Canadiense” in Barcelona, the “Matchgirls” in London, or the “Bread and Roses” strike in New York.\n\nIt is inevitable to see parallels in internet identity management. Initially, users created accounts for each website they wanted to use, often using an alias to maintain pseudo-anonymity. Maintaining accounts involved writing down, memorizing, or repeating passwords, which could be tedious, inefficient, or insecure—but the identity was under the user’s control. This process was greatly simplified with the arrival of Single Sign-On (SSO) systems and the familiar “Sign in with…” option. This allows us to avoid creating multiple accounts for each service, maintaining a reduced number of passwords.\n\nAt first, it seems that companies do us a “favor” by storing our passwords, but in return, we are losing our freedom. These companies control all information about us: browsing history, devices we use, locations we visit, and even our biometrics. With this data, organizations can aggregate it and generate profiles, which allows them to predict users’ routines and preferences. These profiles are what we know as users’ digital identities. This is what we have relinquished.\n\nInitially, the tracking had a seemingly good purpose: to create a more personalized and pleasant experience for each user. However, this assumption collapsed as the data-selling business was discovered. This traffic often occurs without users’ knowledge, proving we do not have control over our digital identities. Worse, data repositories of companies like Google, Facebook, or Apple have become targets for cybercriminals. A single successful attack can compromise thousands to millions of user accounts, enabling identity theft or access to other associated data.\n\n## Taking Back Control\n\nSelf-sovereign identity restores control over personal data to the user, eliminating intermediaries and preventing data abuse. In this model, the user is the sole manager of their identity, decides which information to share and with whom, and has full control over the level of anonymity they wish to maintain. Identities are portable and interoperable. Additionally, users can always approve third-party access to their data, revealing only the minimum information necessary for each process. This information is recorded as verifiable credentials, designed to mimic their physical counterparts while adding a layer of security via cryptography. Along with credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are used, allowing us to present information about ourselves while preserving privacy and anonymity.\n\nFor example, when we shop online, the seller does not need to know exactly who we are, just as when we enter a store in a mall we do not need to carry our ID. Still, companies like Amazon ask for nearly our entire digital identity to purchase a simple product. Using verifiable credentials and DIDs, we could implement systems that emulate physical-world interactions, freeing users’ data from corporate control.\n\n## Challenges\n\nTo work with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, we need a digital wallet designed for a self-sovereign identity system. It allows secure storage of credentials and private keys. With a self-sovereign wallet, users can use hundreds of different identifiers online transparently, preventing organizations from easily linking them. This is equivalent to pre-“Sign in with” operation but without remembering passwords. Moreover, these wallets are less attractive to hackers as compromising a single wallet would require disproportionate effort to access an individual’s digital identity, which is initially anonymous.\n\nDeveloping a wallet involves many design considerations, such as the cryptography used by DIDs or the format and protocol for credential communication. Here arises a conflict: the lack of industry consensus on communication protocols. Without consensus, wallets based on different protocols would not be interoperable, complicating adoption and potentially forcing users to maintain multiple wallets, violating the principle of simplicity.\n\nFor this reason, within the Sigma project funded by IVACE-FEDER (file number IMDEEA/2023/45), ITI is working on a multi-protocol wallet compatible with the two most mature protocols today: OpenID and Aries, allowing high interoperability with other wallets. This mechanism also enables expanding supported protocols if no consensus is reached in the short/mid-term, avoiding multiple digital wallets. Promoting this technology will help privacy and digital identities return to users’ control, gradually freeing us from corporate oversight.",
