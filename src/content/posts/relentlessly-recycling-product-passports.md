Over the past few years, you’ve likely heard about the 2030 Agenda. Since its approval in 2015, it has gradually influenced almost every aspect of our lives: from justifying projects aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to laws that might seem unusual, such as bans on glitter or ham-flavored potato chips. While some measures may seem disconnected from everyday reality, they are usually based on international studies and research.

This is part of a broader trend, where sustainability has moved from being a marginal consideration to a cross-cutting criterion, reaching details as specific as microplastics in glitter. In this context, the European Sustainable Product Regulation (ESPR) emerges as one of the latest European Commission initiatives to advance a circular economy. This is not the first regulation of its kind: a 2009 directive already focused on energy-consuming products. The difference now is that the scope has broadened to apply to virtually any physical product entering the market.

Traditionally, the approach to a more sustainable society relied on the “3R” strategy: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. ESPR expands this to the “9R” strategy, introducing new Rs such as: Reject (avoid unsustainable products at the design stage); Rethink (redesign for durability); Repair, Refurbish, and Rebuild; and Recover (e.g., incinerate waste to obtain energy). Together, the 9Rs promote smarter production and consumption, extend product lifespans, and suggest uses for discarded materials.

These requirements are not the ESPR’s only responsibility. It also mandates that public European bodies purchase more sustainable versions of goods and services. Measures include prohibiting disposal of unsold products, especially in textiles and footwear, and opening this approach to new sectors. Crucially, it introduces the **Digital Product Passport (DPP)**: a digital identity for products, components, and materials with relevant information. The regulation does not specify exact content or technical implementation, only minimum requirements.

In general terms, these requirements focus on ensuring secure and controlled access to passport data for all actors involved in a product’s lifecycle. The information must be authentic, integral, and available throughout the product’s life. For example, someone buying a second-hand phone—like a classic Blackberry on a marketplace—should be able to verify authenticity, check repair history, and find recycling instructions, even if the original manufacturer no longer exists (Blackberry ceased operations in 2016), while ensuring reliable information.

While the digital product passport concept sounds promising, it raises questions due to the ESPR’s lack of detail. Implementation will be gradual and slow. Initially, it aimed to be operational by the end of 2025 for batteries—now postponed to 2027—and later expanded to other sectors every three years.

This raises key questions: where is the limit? Will even a shoelace eyelet require its own digital passport? In many cases, the cost of implementing and maintaining the passport could far exceed the product’s value. This is one of the main challenges in creating a universal passport applicable across industries, as industrial differences lead to varying needs and requirements.

For instance, in the energy sector—the first target industry—tracking per battery unit is crucial. Last year alone, Europe imported nearly a million tons of lithium batteries, a highly polluting material if not recycled properly. Conversely, tracking every manufactured screw at this level would be pointless. ESPR allows passport granularity choices: unit, batch, or product model. Here, the regulation’s ambiguity is an advantage.

## ITI’s Role

ITI has been working on self-sovereign identity and blockchain technologies for several years. We won’t dive into technical details here, but the Digital Product Passport is essentially a digital identity for products, capturing key information. Our expertise in these technologies aligns perfectly with ESPR’s requirements. Some readers may note that blockchain and energy savings do not always go hand in hand—Bitcoin, for example, consumed around 150 TWh in 2024, roughly three times Portugal’s energy use. Not all blockchains are the same: many operate with minimal energy while maintaining servers without cryptocurrency mining.

This digital product passport solution, based on self-sovereign identity and blockchain, is part of the **OMEGA project**, representing our contribution to the international research effort. Valencian companies in the footwear and battery sectors have agreed to collaborate on the next phase, bringing our solution to real-world applications. If your company is interested, reflect on the concept, remember we are here to assist, and consider partnering to solve your challenges.
